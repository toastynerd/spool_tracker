# Spool Tracker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toastynerd/spool_tracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toastynerd/spool_tracker)

This app is for gathering data on 3d prints and what setting are successful for sepecific prints.
Upcoming features will include reading simple rfid tags on spools 
using an [RC522 chip](https://lastminuteengineers.com/how-rfid-works-rc522-arduino-tutorial/)
and a web-serial connection to auto populate the last setting used for a print.

The app will also read and save settings from the Prusa Slic3r .ini settings export
and eventually from 3MF files themselves.
